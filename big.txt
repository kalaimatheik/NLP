the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The Company clears some of its customers’ transactions through Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC (WFCS),
an affiliated broker-dealer, on a fully disclosed basis.
The Company self clears the majority of its institutional customer accommodation and market-making
transactions. Some futures are carried and cleared by an unaffiliated broker-dealer.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2019

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) requires lessees to recognize leases on
the Statement of Financial Condition with lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets based on
the present value of lease payments. The Company adopted the guidance in January 2019 using the modified
retrospective method and practical expedients for transition. The practical expedients allowed the Company
to largely account for its leases Standard consistent with prior guidance except for the incremental Statement of
Financial Condition recognition for lessees. The implementation of this guidance did not have a material
impact on the measurement, recognition or disclosure of leases in its Statement of Financial Condition.
(b)

Accounting guidance not yet adopted

ASU 2016-13 Standard Performace Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326) changes the accounting
for credit losses on loans and debt securities. For loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, the new
3

WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC
(An Indirect Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company)
Notes to Statement of Financial Condition
June 30, 2019
(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
guidance requires a current expected credit loss (CECL) approach to determine the allowance for credit
losses. CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The guidance is effective January
2020 with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption.
While early adoption was permitted beginning in January 2019, the Company did not elect the option. The
Company is still evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its Statement of Financial Condition.
(c)

Securities Purchased/Sold Under Agreements to Resell/Repurchase

Transactions involving securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) or
securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) are treated as collateralized
financing transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts. These transactions
are primarily repurchase agreements of United States government and agency securities and corporate
bonds. The Company’s exposure to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of customers in fulfilling
these contractual obligations can be directly affected by volatile trading markets, which may impair the
customers’ ability to satisfy their obligations to the Company. It is the Company’s policy to report reverse
repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty on a net basis when the
conditions for netting as specified in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) are met.
It is the Company’s policy to obtain possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The
Company manages the credit risk associated with these transactions by monitoring the market value of the
collateral obtained, including accrued interest, and by requesting additional collateral when deemed
appropriate.
(d)

Securities Transactions

Financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased are carried at fair value and
recorded on a trade-date basis.
Customers’ securities transactions are recorded on a settlement date basis with related commission revenue
and expenses recorded on a trade-date basis. Securities owned by customers, including those that
collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not reflected in the Statement of Financial Condition
as the Company does not have title to those assets. In the event of uncompleted transactions on settlement
date, the Company records corresponding receivables and payables, respectively. The carrying value of the
receivables and payables approximates their fair values.
(e)

Securities Lending Activity

Securities borrowed and securities loaned are reported as collateralized financing transactions and are
carried at the contracted amounts of cash collateral received or paid in connection with those transactions.
The Company receives collateral generally in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company
monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis, with additional collateral
obtained or refunded as necessary.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, when the Company borrows securities against securities collateral, the
Company is not required to record those transactions in the Statement of Financial Condition.

(f)

Derivatives

Derivative financial instruments are used for trading purposes, including economic hedges of trading
instruments, and are recorded at fair value. Fair values for exchange traded derivatives, principally futures
and certain options, are based on quoted market prices. Fair values for over-the-counter derivative financial
instruments, principally interest rate, credit default or total return swaps, forwards, and options, are based
on quoted market prices for similar instruments, pricing models and discounted cash flow analyses, and are
included in financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the
accompanying Statement of Financial Condition.
Most of the Company’s derivative transactions are executed under master netting arrangements. The
Company reflects all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject to enforceable master netting
arrangements on a net basis in the Statement of Financial Condition. Statement of Financial Condition
netting adjustments are determined based on the terms specified within each master netting arrangement
and at the counterparty level for which there may be multiple contract types. For disclosure purposes,
adjustments are allocated to the contract type for each counterparty proportionately based upon gross
amounts recognized by counterparty. As a result, the net amounts disclosed by contract type may not
represent the actual exposure upon settlement of the contracts. Statement of Financial Condition netting
does not include non-cash collateral that is received and pledged.
The Company applies settlement to market treatment for the cash collateralizing its interest rate derivative
contracts with certain centrally cleared counterparties. As a result, derivative balances with these
counterparties are considered settled by the collateral.
(g)

Income Taxes

The Company is a single member limited liability company and is treated as a disregarded entity pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 for federal income tax purposes. Generally, disregarded entities
are not subject to entity-level federal or state income taxation and, as such, the Company does not provide
for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes. The Company’s taxable income is reported in the
tax return of Everen. There are no tax sharing agreements between the Company and Everen.
Certain states and foreign jurisdictions may subject the Company to entity-level taxation as a single member
limited liability company; however, there is not a material provision for state and foreign income taxes for
period ended June 30, 2019. The Company files tax returns in various states and local jurisdictions and is
subject to income tax examinations by those tax authorities for years 2007 and forward.
Due to the Company’s status as a disregarded entity for income tax purposes, the related balance sheet
accounts including income tax receivable/payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities are immaterial to
the Statement of Financial Condition.
Morning stars 
Based upon its evaluation, the Company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain income tax
positions relevant to the jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns requiring recognition in
the Statement of Financial Condition. Management monitors proposed and issued tax laws, regulations and
cases to determine the potential impact to uncertain income tax positions. The Company had no accrued
interest or penalties at June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, management had not identified any potential
5

Notes to Statement of Financial Condition

(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
subsequent events that would have a material impact on unrecognized income tax benefits within the next
twelve months.
(h)

Goodwill

Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more
often if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. The Company has an option of performing
a qualitative assessment of goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed
directly to a quantitative test to compare the estimated fair value to the carrying value. If the reporting unit’s
fair value is less than the carrying amount, an additional test is required to measure the amount of
impairment. The Company recognizes impairment losses as a charge to expenses and an adjustment to the
carrying value of the goodwill asset. The Company’s most recent impairment evaluation indicated that the
Company’s goodwill was not impaired and there are no events or circumstances that indicate possible
impairment as of June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, WFS had one reporting unit.
(i)

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis using estimated
useful lives, which generally range from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease.
(j)

Use of estimates

The preparation of the Statement of Financial Condition in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Statement of Financial Condition and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
(3)

Cash and Securities Segregated Pursuant to Federal Regulations

Under the provisions of Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a reserve requirement
did not exist at June 30, 2019 and therefore no cash or securities were on deposit at June 30, 2019. There is no
required deposit for the proprietary accounts of brokers (PAB), and therefore no cash or securities were on deposit
at June 30, 2019.
As an FCM, the Company is required to segregate funds in a cleared swap customer account, a secured funds
account and a segregated funds account under rules mandated by the CFTC. For these purposes, $118,372,
$55,450, and $15,420, respectively, is held in accounts at non affiliate banks and is reflected in cash segregated
pursuant to federal regulations in the Statement of Financial Condition. In addition, $890,837 of client cleared
swaps funds, $47,582 of secured funds and $444,826 of segregated funds, are held in accounts at an affiliate bank,
and reflected in cash segregated pursuant to Federal regulations in the Statement of Financial Condition.
The Company is required to post margin at exchanges to meet customer and firm requirements. The Company
deposited $2,672,580 of investments of customer funds in securities with clearing organizations as margin at June
30, 2019. These segregated securities are included in financial instruments owned, at fair value in the Statement
6

of Financial Condition. The Company also entered into securities purchased under agreement to resell contracts
using $10,701 of customers’ secured funds at June 30, 2019.
Additionally, the Company segregated $6,418,356 of customer specific owned securities deposited at nonaffiliated banks and clearing organizations at June 30, 2019. These segregated securities are not included in the
Statement of Financial Condition.
(4)

Receivable from and Payable to Customers

Receivable from and payable to customers represent the balances arising in connection with the settlement of
cash securities, derivative and securities-based lending transactions. Receivables from customers also include
margin loans to customers and customer cash debits. Payable to customers includes customer free credits. It is
the Company’s policy to report margin loans and payables that arise due to positive cash flows in the same
customer’s accounts on a net basis when the conditions for netting as specified in U.S. GAAP are met. The
amounts receivable from customers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the customer, the value of
which is not reflected in the accompanying Statement of Financial Condition. At June 30, 2019, customer
receivables of $65,417 were unsecured.
The Company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to offset amounts deemed uncollectible from
unsecured customer balances receivable. Receivable from customers is reported net of the allowance for doubtful
accounts in the amount of $2,846 as of June 30, 2019.

$300,755 included in corporate obligations in the table above.

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) and Securitizations

The Company acts as underwriter for other subsidiaries of WFC and third parties that securitize financial assets,
and may make a market in these securitized financial assets. These securities are accounted for at fair value and
are included in financial instruments owned, at fair value in the Statement of Financial Condition.
The Company purchases and sells financial instruments in VIEs in connection with its market making activities.
These financial instruments in VIEs include senior and subordinated tranches of collateralized mortgage
obligations (CMOs), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and other
8

WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC

Notes to Statement of Financial Condition

asset backed securities. The Company has made no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or commitments with third
parties related to these holdings. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs is limited to
the carrying amount of the financial instruments owned.
During the period ended June 30, 2019, there were no transfers of debt securities into VIEs. The prior
securitizations were primarily U.S. government agency or U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE)
sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations. These securitizations were done principally on behalf of customers
to facilitate their purchase of agency backed mortgage securities that conform to their investment profile. The
Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because it does not have the power to direct the activities
that most significantly impact the U.S. government agency or U.S. GSE sponsored collateralized mortgage
obligation entities. As of June, 30, 2019, the Company held $86,510 of securities related to securitizations for
which the Company included in financial instruments owned, at fair value in the Statement of Financial Condition.
The Company would consolidate a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that has both
the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s performance and the obligation to absorb
losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company was not required
to consolidate any interest in VIEs.
The following tables provide a summary of unconsolidated VIEs with which the Company has significant
continuing involvement. Significant continuing involvement includes transactions where the Company was the
sponsor or transferor and has other significant forms of involvement. Sponsorship includes transactions with
unconsolidated VIEs where the Company solely or materially participated in the initial design or structuring of
the entity or marketing of the transaction to investors. When the Company transfers assets to a VIE and accounts
for the transfer as a sale, the Company is considered the transferor. The tables do not include offsetting financial
instruments that are held to mitigate the risks associated with these variable interest entities.
In the following tables, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining principal balance of assets held by
unconsolidated VIEs using the most current information available. “Carrying value” is the amount in our
Statement of Financial Condition related to our involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure
to loss” from our involvement with off-balance sheet entities equals the carrying value of involvement with offbalance sheet (unconsolidated) VIEs as of June 30, 2019, as the Company does not have any other commitments
or guarantees with those entities.

Fair Value Measurements

In accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, the Company groups its assets and liabilities
measured at fair value in three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the
reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:
Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which
all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market.
These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of marker comparable pricing, option pricing models,
discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
In the determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy,
the Company considers all available information, including observable market data, indications of market
liquidity and orderliness, and the Company’s understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs
used. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are
made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety.
If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.
The following sections describe the valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure classes of financial
instruments at fair value and specify the level in the fair value hierarchy where various financial instruments are
generally classified. Valuation models, significant inputs to those models and any significant assumptions are
included where appropriate.
The Company uses quoted prices in active markets, where available, and classifies such instruments within Level
1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange traded equity securities and some highly liquid
government securities such as U.S. Treasuries. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted
market prices do not exist for such securities, the Company generally relies on internal valuation techniques or
on prices obtained from third party pricing services (vendors) or brokers or combination thereof, and accordingly,
classifies these instruments as Level 2 or 3.
10

WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC

Notes to Statement of Financial Condition
June 30, 2019
(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
Financial instruments are mostly valued using internal trader prices that are subject to price verification
procedures performed by independent internal personnel. The majority of fair values derived using internal
valuation techniques are verified against multiple pricing sources, including prices obtained from third party
vendors. Vendors compile prices from various sources and often apply matrix pricing for similar securities when
no price is observable. The Company reviews pricing methodologies provided by the vendors in order to
determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. When evaluating the
appropriateness of an internal trader price compared with vendor prices, considerations include the range and
quality of vendor prices. Vendor or broker prices are used to ensure the reasonableness of a trader price; however
valuing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from knowledge of a particular market. If a trader
asserts that a vendor or broker price is not reflective of market value, justification for using the trader price,
including recent sales activity where possible, must be provided to and approved by the appropriate levels of
management.
Similarly, while trading securities traded in secondary markets are typically valued using unadjusted vendor
prices, these prices are reviewed and may be adjusted using quoted market prices for similar securities if
determined necessary. These securities are classified as Level 2 of the hierarchy. Examples include certain U.S.
government, U.S. agency and municipal government obligations, corporate obligations, and certain mortgagebacked securities (MBS).
Security fair value measurements using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market due to limited
activity or a less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Such measurements include
securities valued using internal models or a combination of multiple valuation techniques such as weighting of
internal models and vendor or broker pricing, where the unobservable inputs are significant to the overall fair
value measurement. Securities classified as Level 3 include certain residential and commercial MBS, other asset
backed securities, CDOs and certain CLOs, and certain residual and retained interests in residential mortgage loan
securitizations. The Company values CDOs using the prices of similar instruments, the pricing of completed or
pending third party transactions or the pricing of the underlying collateral within the CDO. Where vendor or
broker prices are not readily available, the Company uses management’s best estimate.
The Company enters into both exchange traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Quoted market prices
are available and used for the Company’s exchange traded derivatives, such as certain interest rate futures and
option contracts, which the Company classifies as Level 1. However, a majority of the Company’s derivatives
are traded in OTC markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. OTC derivatives are valued using
internal valuation techniques. Valuation techniques and inputs to internally developed models depend on the type
of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the derivative’s value is based. Key
inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign exchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements
and correlation of such inputs. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not
require significant judgment, such derivatives are typically classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Examples of derivatives classified as Level 2 include generic interest rate swaps and certain option and forward
contracts. When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such
derivatives are classified as Level 3. Examples of derivatives classified as Level 3 include complex and highly
structured derivatives such as certain credit default swaps. Additionally, significant judgments are required when
classifying financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy, particularly between Level 2 and 3, as is the case
for certain derivatives.

The netting of securities owned (assets) by the amount of securities sold but not yet purchased (liabilities) occurs when the securities
owned and the securities sold but not yet purchased have identical Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIPs)
numbers. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement and related cash collateral are
also netted on the accompanying Statement of Financial Condition when GAAP conditions have been met.

Changes in Fair Value Levels
The availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial
instruments within the fair value hierarchy and transfer between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly.
Observable market data includes but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in economic
conditions or market liquidity generally will drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in

Corporate Obligations are shown net of $(13) of Corporate Obligations sold, not yet purchased.

The valuation techniques used for Level 3 assets and liabilities, as presented in the previous tables, are described
as follows:
•

Market Comparable Pricing – Used to determine the fair value of certain instruments by incorporating
known inputs such as recent transaction prices, pending transactions, or prices of other similar
investments which require significant adjustment to reflect differences in instrument characteristics.

•

Option Price Modeling – Generally used for instruments in which the holder has a contingent right or
obligation based on the occurrence of a future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going above
or below a predetermined strike price. Option pricing models estimate the likelihood of the specified
event occurring by incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price of the underlying
instrument and expected rate of return.

Use of these techniques requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent
significant unobservable inputs as indicated in the preceding tables. Accordingly, changes in these unobservable
inputs may have a significant impact on fair value.
Certain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of
the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an
opposite direction for a given change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used within the valuation
technique of an asset or liability, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change
in another input having a potentially muted impact to the overall fair value of that particular instrument.
Additionally, a change in one unobservable input may result in a change to another unobservable input (that is,
changes in certain inputs are interrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify the fair value impact.

Notes to Statement of Financial Condition
June 30, 2019
(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
Significant unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are those considered significant to the fair value
of the Level 3 asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are considered to be significant, if by their exclusion, the
fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage change or based on
qualitative factors, such as nature of the instrument, type of valuation techniques used, and the significance of the
unobservable inputs relative to other inputs used within the valuation. Following is a description of the significant
unobservable inputs provided in the tables.
•

Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to observed market data, such as a transaction price
in order to reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other factors used within a
market valuation approach expressed as a percentage of an observed price.

•

Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is estimated to fluctuate over a specified
period of time expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time.

•

Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument changing in price relative to another based on
an established relationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a period over time.

Employee Benefits, Deferred Compensation and Stock Plans

Defined Contribution Retirement Plans
WFC sponsors a qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the 401(k) Plan). Under the 401(k) Plan,
after one month of service, eligible employees may contribute up to 50% of their certified compensation,
subject to statutory limits. Eligible employees who complete one year of service are eligible for quarterly
company matching contributions, which are generally dollar for dollar up to 6% of an employee's eligible
certified compensation. Matching contributions are 100% vested. The 401(k) Plan includes an employer
discretionary profit sharing contribution feature to allow WFC to make a contribution to eligible employees’
401(k) Plan accounts for a plan year. Eligible employees who complete one year of service are eligible for
profit sharing contributions. Profit sharing contributions are vested after three years of service.
Deferred Compensation and Stock Plans
The Company participates in WFC’s unfunded deferred compensation plan in which a select group of
management or highly compensated individuals are participants, as defined. Awards consist of long-term
deferred cash awards, restricted stock rights (RSRs) and performance share awards (PSAs), which may be
granted periodically to certain employees.
The deferred portion of the award further takes the form of RSRs, PSAs and Long Term Cash. Deferred
cash incentive awards generally vest over a three-year period while, RSRs and PSAs generally vest over
three to five years, during which time the holder may be entitled to receive additional RSRs, PSAs or cash
payments equal to the cash dividends that would have been paid had the RSRs or PSAs been issued and
outstanding shares of common stock. RSRs and PSAs granted as dividend equivalents are subject to the
same vesting schedule and conditions as the underlying award.
Other Benefits
WFC provides health care and other benefits for certain active and retired employees. The Company
reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate and of the benefits at any time.

Acquisition of Intangible Assets

On December 26, 2017, the Company acquired certain customer contracts and associated relationships from
WFCS. The carrying value of these customer relationships as of June 30, 2019 is $1,323 and is included in
other assets on the Statement of Financial Condition. The asset is being amortized over a three year period
on an accelerated basis. No impairment losses were recorded during the period ended June 30, 2019 with
respect to this asset.
(13) Derivatives
The Company is a party to derivative financial instruments and commitments in the normal course of business to
meet the financing needs of customers, conduct trading activities, and manage market risks. These derivative
financial instruments include futures, options, swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to purchase and sell
securities, securities purchased and sold on a when issued basis (when issued securities), and firm underwriting
commitments. These instruments and commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and market
risk. Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according
to the terms of the contract. Market risk is the possibility that a change in interest rates, the underlying assets,
indices or a combination of these factors will cause an unfavorable change in the value of a financial instrument.
The Company controls the credit risk arising from these instruments and commitments through its credit approval
process and through the use of risk control limits and monitoring procedures. It evaluates each customer’s or other
broker dealer’s creditworthiness on a case by case basis. If collateral is deemed necessary to reduce credit risk,
the amount and nature of the collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation of the other party.
Based on the Company’s assessment of each of its counterparties, additional collateral was not required by the
Company at June 30, 2019.
The notional principal or contractual amounts of derivative financial instruments exceed the probable loss that
could arise from counterparty default or market related risks. The fair value of derivative financial instruments
represents principally the estimated unrealized gain (asset) or loss (liability) and is recorded in financial
instruments owned, at fair value or financial instruments sold, not yet purchased in the Statement of Financial
Condition. The market risk associated with trading financial instruments, including derivatives, the prices of
which are constantly fluctuating, is managed by imposing limits as to the type, amounts, and degree of risk that
traders may undertake. These limits, approved by senior management and the risk positions of traders, are
reviewed on a daily basis to monitor compliance with the limits.

Represents balance sheet netting of derivative asset and liability balances and related cash collateral. See the next
table in this Note for further information.

Forward and commodity contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments
in which the seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price
or yield. Equity contracts are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell a financial instrument
at a specified price and within a specified period of time from the seller or writer of the option. As a writer of
options, the Company receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the
price of the financial instrument underlying the option and other market risk factors that may impact the fair value
of the option.
The following table provides information on the gross fair values of assets and liabilities, the Statement of
Financial Condition netting adjustments and the resulting net fair value amount recorded in the Statement of
Financial Condition, as well as the non-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. The “Net Amounts”
column within the following table represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after
considering the Statement of Financial Condition and disclosure-only netting adjustments. We manage derivative
exposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each counterparty using counterparty specific credit limits,
using master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral. Derivative contracts executed in over-the-counter
markets include bilateral contractual arrangements that are not cleared through a central clearing organization but
are typically subject to master netting arrangements. The percentage of our bilateral derivative transactions
outstanding at period end in such markets, based on gross fair value, is provided within the following table. Other
derivative contracts executed in over-the-counter or exchange-traded markets are settled through a central clearing
organization and are excluded from this percentage.
In addition to the netting amounts included in the table, we also have Statement of Financial Condition netting
related to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed within Note 16. The Company has no derivatives
that contain features that are contingent upon the credit ratings of the Company or its affiliates.

(1) Represents amounts with counterparties subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that have been offset in the Statement of Financial Condition,
including related cash collateral and portfolio level counterparty valuation adjustments. There were no counterparty valuation adjustments related
to derivative assets or derivative liabilities at June 30, 2019. Additionally, cash collateral amounts of $104,149 and $176,828 were netted against derivative
assets and liabilities, respectively, at June 30, 2019.
(2) Net derivative assets are classified in financial instruments owned, at fair value, and Net derivative liabilities are classified in financial instruments sold,
not yet purchased, at fair value, in the Statement of Financial Condition.
(3) Represents non-cash collateral pledged and received against derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty that are subject to enforceable
master netting arrangements. U.S. GAAP does not permit netting of such non-cash collateral balances in the Statement of Financial Condition, but
requires disclosure of these amounts.
(4) Represents derivatives executed in over-the-counter markets that are not settled through a central clearing organization. Over-the-counter percentages
are calculated based on gross amounts recognized as of the balance sheet date. The remaining percentage represents derivatives settled through a central
clearing organization, which are executed in either over-the-counter or exchange-traded markets.

Credit Derivatives
The Company uses credit derivatives to manage exposure to credit risk related to its customer accommodation
and market making activity. This may include protection purchased to offset securities owned or sold protection.
This credit risk management provides an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that would be
paid under the credit derivatives written by the Company. The majority of the credit contracts are executed with
an affiliate, WFBNA, and the Company would be required to perform under the noted credit derivatives in the
event of a default by the referenced obligors. Excluded from maximum exposure are written credit protection
contracts with a notional amount of $838,796 where the Company has also purchased offsetting credit protection
with the same counterparty, WFBNA, on the same referenced obligation and where the term and amount of the
purchased protection equals or exceeds the term of the written credit protection. Events of default include events
such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack principal and/or interest payment. In certain cases, other triggers
may exist, such as the credit downgrade of the referenced obligors. The following table provides details of sold
and purchased credit derivatives as of June 30, 2019.

The Protection sold – non-investment grade category is based on the portion of the maximum loss exposure for
which there is a greater risk that the Company will be required to make a payment or perform under the credit
derivative. The current status of the risk of payment or performance being required is considered high if the
underlying assets under the credit derivative have an external rating that is below investment grade or an internal
credit default grade that would be equivalent to below investment grade external rating. It is important to note
that the Protection sold – non-investment grade represents the amount of exposure which would be incurred under
an assumed hypothetical circumstance and, accordingly, this disclosure is not an indication of expected loss for
which payment is of a high likelihood. Such payment may not result in a loss. As such, the Protection sold – noninvestment grade column is not an indication of loss probability.
(14) Guarantees, Commitments, and Contingent Liabilities
Underwriting Commitments
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into debt and equity underwriting commitments.
Transactions relating to such underwriting commitments that were open at June 30, 2019, and were subsequently
settled had no material impact on the Company’s Statement of Financial Condition.
Litigation
The Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions arising from its normal business activities,
and many of those proceedings expose the Company to potential financial loss. We establish accruals for legal
actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential
losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the
low end of the range of those potential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially
higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions. Based on information currently available, advice of
counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, the Company believes that the eventual outcome
of the actions against it will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material
to the Company’s Statement of Financial Condition for any particular period.
Exchange and Clearing House Guarantees
The Company is a member of exchanges and clearing houses that the Company uses to clear its trades and those
of the Company’s customers. It is common that all members in these organizations are required to collectively
23

WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC
(An Indirect Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company)
Notes to Statement of Financial Condition
June 30, 2019
(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
guarantee the performance of other members. Our obligations under the guarantees are based on a fixed amount
or a multiple of the collateral we are required to maintain with these organizations. The Company has not recorded
a liability for these arrangements because we believe the likelihood of loss is remote. The maximum exposure to
loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite
what it believes is an extremely remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral
declines to zero. The maximum exposure to loss related to our clearing house arrangements at June 30, 2019 is
$3,528,597. The Company has made deposits with clearing organization in the form of cash of $1,503,075. The
Company has also made deposits with clearing organizations with pledged collateral of $1,329,565.
The Company clears transactions on behalf of its clients through various clearing houses, and the Company stands
behind the performance of its clients on such trades. The Company mitigates its exposure to loss in the event of
a client default by requiring that clients provide appropriate amounts of margin at the inception and throughout
the life of the transaction. The Company may cease providing clearing services to clients if they do not adhere to
their obligations under the clearing agreement. It is difficult to estimate the Company’s maximum exposure under
such transactions, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. The
Company manages the exposure through setting credit limits for clients and maintaining termination right over
clearing contracts. However, based upon historical experience, the Company believes it is unlikely that it will
have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.
Other Contingencies
The Company introduces certain of its customer transactions to an affiliated clearing broker, WFCS, with whom
it has a correspondent relationship for clearance and depository services in accordance with the terms of the
clearance agreement. In connection therewith, the Company has agreed to indemnify WFCS for credit losses that
WFCS may sustain as a result of the failure of the Company’s customers to satisfy their obligations in connection
with their securities transactions. As of June 30, 2019, substantially all customer obligations were collateralized
by securities with a market value in excess of the obligations.
Some contracts that the Company enters into in the normal course of business include indemnification provisions
that obligate the Company to make payments to the counterparty or others in the event certain events occur. The
contingencies generally relate to the changes in the value of underlying assets, liabilities, or equity securities or
upon the occurrence of events, such as an adverse litigation judgment or an adverse interpretation of the tax law.
The indemnification clauses are often standard performance of 10 years average annual returns contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of
business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. Since there are no stated or notional
amounts included in the indemnification clauses and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify have
not occurred and are not expected to occur, the Company is not able to estimate the maximum potential amount
of future payments under these indemnification clauses. There are no amounts reflected in the Statement of
Financial Condition as of June 30, 2019, related to these indemnifications.
On February 2, 2018, WFC entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (“FRB”). As required by the consent order, the WFC’s Board of Directors submitted to the FRB a plan
to further enhance its governance and oversight of WFC, and WFC submitted to the FRB a plan to further
improve its compliance and operational risk management program. WFC continues to engage with the FRB as it
works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires WFC, following the FRB’s
acceptance and approval of the plans and WFC’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an
24

WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC
(An Indirect Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company)
Notes to Statement of Financial Condition

(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party
review is complete and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, WFC’s total
consolidated assets will be limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap will be
measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. At June 30,
2019, WFC’s total consolidated assets, as calculated pursuant to the requirements of the consent order, were
below the level of total assets as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, after removal of the asset cap, a second
third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and
improvements.

Securities Financing Activities

The Company enters into resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements
(collectively, “securities financing activities”) primarily to finance inventory positions, acquire securities to cover
short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing needs, and settle other securities obligations. The
majority of securities financing activities involve high quality, liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities
and government agency securities, and to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities,
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. These transactions are accounted for as collateralized financings
which are typically received or pledged securities as collateral. These financing transactions generally do not have
material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring processes.
Offsetting of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements
The table below presents resale and repurchase agreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) and
securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to master securities lending agreements (MSLA). The
Company accounts for transactions subject to these agreements as collateralized financings, and those with a
single counterparty are presented net on the Statement of Financial Condition, provided certain criteria are met
that permit netting. Most transactions subject to these agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not
eligible for Statement of Financial Condition netting. There were no securities borrowing or lending agreements
subject to MSLAs that were eligible for netting.
Collateral pledged consists of non-cash instruments, such as securities or loans, and is not netted on the Statement
of Financial Condition against the related liability. Collateral received includes securities or loans and is not
recognized in the Statement of Financial Condition. Collateral pledged or received may be increased or decreased
over time to maintain certain contractual thresholds as the assets underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value.
Generally, these agreements require collateral to exceed the asset or liability recognized in the Statement of
Financial Condition. The following table includes the amount of collateral pledged or received related to
exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs.

While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure in this table to limit the
amount of such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or liability for each counterparty:

(7)

Represents the amount of our exposure that is not covered by pledged collateral and/or is not subject to an enforceable

Repurchase and securities lending agreements
Securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements are effectively short-term
collateralized borrowings. In these transactions, cash is received in exchange for transferring securities as
collateral and an obligation is recognized to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction's maturity. These
26

WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC
(An Indirect Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company)
Notes to Statement of Financial Condition
June 30, 2019
(Unaudited, Dollars in thousands)
types of transactions create risks, including (1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity; (2)
the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below the amount of our obligation to reacquire the
securities, and therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional amounts; and (3) the counterparty may
accelerate the maturity on demand, requiring the Company to reacquire the security prior to contractual maturity.
The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by the fact that the majority of our securities financing activities
involve highly liquid securities; we underwrite and monitor the financial strength of our counterparties; we
monitor the fair value of collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase amounts; and we monitor
that our collateral is properly returned through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our cash payment.

securities lending agreements.

Repurchase and securities lending transactions are primarily conducted under enforceable master lending agreements that allow either party to
terminate the transaction on demand. These transactions have been reported as continuous obligations unless the MRA or MSLA has been
modified with an overriding agreement that specifies an alternative termination date.

(16) Net Capital
The Company is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) and the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17 which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. Under
SEC Rule 15c3-1, the Company has elected to use the alternative method, permitted by the rule, which requires
that the Company maintain minimum net capital, as defined, equal to the greater of $1,500 or 2% of combined
aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions, as defined. Under CFTC Regulation 1.17, the
Company is required to maintain an adjusted net capital equivalent to the greater of $1,500 or $959,793, which
was 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer and non-customer accounts plus
additional net capital requirements related to certain reverse repurchase agreements. At June 30, 2019, the
Company had net capital of $8,579,884, which was 53.69% of aggregate debit items and $7,620,091 in excess of
the minimum net capital requirement.
(17) Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated the effects of subsequent events that have occurred subsequent to June 30, 2019 and
through August 29, 2019 the date the Company issued its Statement of Financial Condition. During this period,
there have been no material subsequent events that would require recognition or disclosure in the Statement of
Financial Condition.
