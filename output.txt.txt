TIPS.

FROM RECRUITERS AND
HIRING MANAGERS.

This is less about impressing us, and more about you getting the
future you want. These are our top tips:
Prepare
We get tens of thousands of applications each year from which we identify the
relatively small group of people who have the drive, creativity, academic credentials,
intellectual agility, and interpersonal skills to thrive in our business. Read our
website for in-depth information about our business areas. You’ll need to tell us
which one you want to join – and why. Read the business press. Attend our events.
Talk to people you know who work here. Discover all you can about the wider
context of the industry.

Get to know us
We think the best way to get inside any organization is to actually get inside that
organization. That’s why we run a number of events on campus and at our offices
where you can meet us and talk to us, face-to-face. More details are on the
Campus Schedule section of our website.

Think over your decision
Before you apply, think carefully about your application. Take a long-term
perspective and look at the big picture. Some of the best careers are launched
and built during the toughest markets. Explore what we have to offer as an employer,
and reflect on all the strengths and qualities that you will bring to our business.
That could be extracurricular activities, interesting life experiences or examples
of teamwork, as well as academic achievements.

Start early. Gain experience
We hire the majority of our full-time Analysts and Associates from our internship
class, so it’s worth carefully thinking about your summer internship early.

“Preparation is key. Understand your motivation for
applying and research the company. Talk to our
people. Make a lasting impression by standing out for
the right reasons. Demonstrate your motivation and
drive for the job, think about the questions you may
be asked and prepare for them. Above all else, don’t
act a part – just be yourself.”

Wherever you are in the world, making a wise decision about your career is easier
to do when you participate in our special initiatives and take advantage of our events.

Make a lasting impression
We work closely with our clients, so we want to see the strength of your personality.
Think of specific examples that demonstrate your qualities and behaviors, whether
you have led a team project or organized an event on campus.

In the end, this is not just about impressing us. You need to be
sure that this is the profession – and the place – where you will
be most happy, fulfilled and successful.
